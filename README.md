Docker containers for different Ansible versions.

The image purpose is related to make different tests with different versions of Ansible and verify backward compatibility

[Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/padajuan/ansible-docker-base/)

Also there is official images of it, just check the [URLs](https://hub.docker.com/search/?q=ansible&page=1&isAutomated=0&isOfficial=0&pullCount=1&starCount=0)

### Why not different Virtual Envs?
If your base release are Ansible 2.0 you cannot install a 1.9 version of Ansible because it Dependency libraries

Hope this be useful for you.

Enjoy!.
